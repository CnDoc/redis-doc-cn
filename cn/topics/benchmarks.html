        <h1>How fast is Redis?</h1>
        
        <p>Redis includes the <code>redis-benchmark</code> utility that simulates running commands done
        by N clients at the same time sending M total queries (it is similar to the
        Apache&#39;s <code>ab</code> utility). Below you&#39;ll find the full output of a benchmark executed
        against a Linux box.</p>
        
        <p>The following options are supported:</p>
        
        <pre><code>Usage: redis-benchmark [-h &lt;host&gt;] [-p &lt;port&gt;] [-c &lt;clients&gt;] [-n &lt;requests]&gt; [-k &lt;boolean&gt;]&#x000A;&#x000A; -h &lt;hostname&gt;      Server hostname (default 127.0.0.1)&#x000A; -p &lt;port&gt;          Server port (default 6379)&#x000A; -s &lt;socket&gt;        Server socket (overrides host and port)&#x000A; -c &lt;clients&gt;       Number of parallel connections (default 50)&#x000A; -n &lt;requests&gt;      Total number of requests (default 10000)&#x000A; -d &lt;size&gt;          Data size of SET/GET value in bytes (default 2)&#x000A; -k &lt;boolean&gt;       1=keep alive 0=reconnect (default 1)&#x000A; -r &lt;keyspacelen&gt;   Use random keys for SET/GET/INCR, random values for SADD&#x000A;  Using this option the benchmark will get/set keys&#x000A;  in the form mykey_rand:000000012456 instead of constant&#x000A;  keys, the &lt;keyspacelen&gt; argument determines the max&#x000A;  number of values for the random number. For instance&#x000A;  if set to 10 only rand:000000000000 - rand:000000000009&#x000A;  range will be allowed.&#x000A; -P &lt;numreq&gt;        Pipeline &lt;numreq&gt; requests. Default 1 (no pipeline).&#x000A; -q                 Quiet. Just show query/sec values&#x000A; --csv              Output in CSV format&#x000A; -l                 Loop. Run the tests forever&#x000A; -t &lt;tests&gt;         Only run the comma-separated list of tests. The test&#x000A;                    names are the same as the ones produced as output.&#x000A; -I                 Idle mode. Just open N idle connections and wait.&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>You need to have a running Redis instance before launching the benchmark.
        A typical example would be:</p>
        
        <pre><code>redis-benchmark -q -n 100000&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>Using this tool is quite easy, and you can also write your own benchmark,
        but as with any benchmarking activity, there are some pitfalls to avoid.</p>
        
        <h2>Running only a subset of the tests</h2>
        
        <p>You don&#39;t need to run all the default tests every time you execute redis-benchmark.
        The simplest thing to select only a subset of tests is to use the <code>-t</code> option
        like in the following example:</p>
        
        <pre><code>$ redis-benchmark -t set,lpush -n 100000 -q&#x000A;SET: 74239.05 requests per second&#x000A;LPUSH: 79239.30 requests per second&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>In the above example we asked to just run test the SET and LPUSH commands,
        in quiet mode (see the <code>-q</code> switch).</p>
        
        <p>It is also possible to specify the command to benchmark directly like in the
        following example:</p>
        
        <pre><code>$ redis-benchmark -n 100000 -q script load &quot;redis.call(&#39;set&#39;,&#39;foo&#39;,&#39;bar&#39;)&quot;&#x000A;script load redis.call(&#39;set&#39;,&#39;foo&#39;,&#39;bar&#39;): 69881.20 requests per second&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <h2>Selecting the size of the key space</h2>
        
        <p>By default the benchmark runs against a single key. In Redis the difference
        between such a synthetic benchmark and a real one is not huge since it is an
        in-memory system, however it is possible to stress cache misses and in general
        to simulate a more real-world work load by using a large key space.</p>
        
        <p>This is obtained by using the <code>-r</code> switch. For instance if I want to run
        one million SET operations, using a random key for every operation out of
        100k possible keys, I&#39;ll use the following command line:</p>
        
        <pre><code>$ redis-cli flushall&#x000A;OK&#x000A;&#x000A;$ redis-benchmark -t set -r 100000 -n 1000000&#x000A;====== SET ======&#x000A;  1000000 requests completed in 13.86 seconds&#x000A;  50 parallel clients&#x000A;  3 bytes payload&#x000A;  keep alive: 1&#x000A;&#x000A;99.76% `&lt;=` 1 milliseconds&#x000A;99.98% `&lt;=` 2 milliseconds&#x000A;100.00% `&lt;=` 3 milliseconds&#x000A;100.00% `&lt;=` 3 milliseconds&#x000A;72144.87 requests per second&#x000A;&#x000A;$ redis-cli dbsize&#x000A;(integer) 99993&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <h2>Using pipelining</h2>
        
        <p>By default every client (the benchmark simulates 50 clients if not otherwise
        specified with <code>-c</code>) sends the next command only when the reply of the previous
        command is received, this means that the server will likely need a read call
        in order to read each command from every client. Also RTT is payed as well.</p>
        
        <p>Redis supports <a href="pipelining.html">/topics/pipelining</a>, so it is possible to send
        multiple commands at once, a feature often exploited by real world applications.
        Redis pipelining is able to dramatically improve the number of operations per
        second a server is able do deliver.</p>
        
        <p>This is an example of running the benchmark in a Macbook air 11&quot; using a
        pipeling of 16 commands:</p>
        
        <pre><code>$ redis-benchmark -n 1000000 -t set,get -P 16 -q&#x000A;SET: 403063.28 requests per second&#x000A;GET: 508388.41 requests per second&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>Using pipelining results in a significant increase in performance.</p>
        
        <h2>Pitfalls and misconceptions</h2>
        
        <p>The first point is obvious: the golden rule of a useful benchmark is to
        only compare apples and apples. Different versions of Redis can be compared
        on the same workload for instance. Or the same version of Redis, but with
        different options. If you plan to compare Redis to something else, then it is
        important to evaluate the functional and technical differences, and take them
        in account.</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Redis is a server: all commands involve network or IPC roundtrips. It is
        meaningless to compare it to embedded data stores such as SQLite, Berkeley DB,
        Tokyo/Kyoto Cabinet, etc ... because the cost of most operations is 
        primarily in network/protocol management.</li>
        <li>Redis commands return an acknowledgment for all usual commands. Some other
        data stores do not (for instance MongoDB does not implicitly acknowledge write
        operations). Comparing Redis to stores involving one-way queries is only
        mildly useful.</li>
        <li>Naively iterating on synchronous Redis commands does not benchmark Redis
        itself, but rather measure your network (or IPC) latency. To really test Redis,
        you need multiple connections (like redis-benchmark) and/or to use pipelining
        to aggregate several commands and/or multiple threads or processes.</li>
        <li>Redis is an in-memory data store with some optional persistency options. If
        you plan to compare it to transactional servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc ...),
        then you should consider activating AOF and decide on a suitable fsync policy.</li>
        <li>Redis is a single-threaded server. It is not designed to benefit from
        multiple CPU cores. People are supposed to launch several Redis instances to
        scale out on several cores if needed. It is not really fair to compare one
        single Redis instance to a multi-threaded data store.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>A common misconception is that redis-benchmark is designed to make Redis
        performances look stellar, the throughput achieved by redis-benchmark being
        somewhat artificial, and not achievable by a real application. This is
        actually plain wrong.</p>
        
        <p>The redis-benchmark program is a quick and useful way to get some figures and
        evaluate the performance of a Redis instance on a given hardware. However,
        by default, it does not represent the maximum throughput a Redis instance can
        sustain. Actually, by using pipelining and a fast client (hiredis), it is fairly
        easy to write a program generating more throughput than redis-benchmark. The
        default behavior of redis-benchmark is to achieve throughput by exploiting
        concurrency only (i.e. it creates several connections to the server).
        It does not use pipelining or any parallelism at all (one pending query per
        connection at most, and no multi-threading).</p>
        
        <p>To run a benchmark using pipelining mode (and achieve higher throughputs),
        you need to explicitly use the -P option. Please note that it is still a
        realistic behavior since a lot of Redis based applications actively use
        pipelining to improve performance.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, the benchmark should apply the same operations, and work in the same way
        with the multiple data stores you want to compare. It is absolutely pointless to
        compare the result of redis-benchmark to the result of another benchmark
        program and extrapolate.</p>
        
        <p>For instance, Redis and memcached in single-threaded mode can be compared on
        GET/SET operations. Both are in-memory data stores, working mostly in the same
        way at the protocol level. Provided their respective benchmark application is
        aggregating queries in the same way (pipelining) and use a similar number of
        connections, the comparison is actually meaningful.</p>
        
        <p>This perfect example is illustrated by the dialog between Redis (antirez) and
        memcached (dormando) developers.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://antirez.com/post/redis-memcached-benchmark.html">antirez 1 - On Redis, Memcached, Speed, Benchmarks and The Toilet</a></p>
        
        <p><a href="http://dormando.livejournal.com/525147.html">dormando - Redis VS Memcached (slightly better bench)</a></p>
        
        <p><a href="http://antirez.com/post/update-on-memcached-redis-benchmark.html">antirez 2 - An update on the Memcached/Redis benchmark</a></p>
        
        <p>You can see that in the end, the difference between the two solutions is not
        so staggering, once all technical aspects are considered. Please note both
        Redis and memcached have been optimized further after these benchmarks.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, when very efficient servers are benchmarked (and stores like Redis
        or memcached definitely fall in this category), it may be difficult to saturate
        the server. Sometimes, the performance bottleneck is on client side,
        and not server-side. In that case, the client (i.e. the benchmark program itself)
        must be fixed, or perhaps scaled out, in order to reach the maximum throughput.</p>
        
        <h2>Factors impacting Redis performance</h2>
        
        <p>There are multiple factors having direct consequences on Redis performance.
        We mention them here, since they can alter the result of any benchmarks.
        Please note however, that a typical Redis instance running on a low end,
        untuned box usually provides good enough performance for most applications.</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Network bandwidth and latency usually have a direct impact on the performance.
        It is a good practice to use the ping program to quickly check the latency
        between the client and server hosts is normal before launching the benchmark.
        Regarding the bandwidth, it is generally useful to estimate
        the throughput in Gbits/s and compare it to the theoretical bandwidth
        of the network. For instance a benchmark setting 4 KB strings
        in Redis at 100000 q/s, would actually consume 3.2 Gbits/s of bandwidth
        and probably fit within a 10 GBits/s link, but not a 1 Gbits/s one. In many real
        world scenarios, Redis throughput is limited by the network well before being
        limited by the CPU. To consolidate several high-throughput Redis instances
        on a single server, it worth considering putting a 10 Gbits/s NIC
        or multiple 1 Gbits/s NICs with TCP/IP bonding.</li>
        <li>CPU is another very important factor. Being single-threaded, Redis favors
        fast CPUs with large caches and not many cores. At this game, Intel CPUs are
        currently the winners. It is not uncommon to get only half the performance on
        an AMD Opteron CPU compared to similar Nehalem EP/Westmere EP/Sandy Bridge
        Intel CPUs with Redis. When client and server run on the same box, the CPU is
        the limiting factor with redis-benchmark.</li>
        <li>Speed of RAM and memory bandwidth seem less critical for global performance
        especially for small objects. For large objects (&gt;10 KB), it may become
        noticeable though. Usually, it is not really cost-effective to buy expensive
        fast memory modules to optimize Redis.</li>
        <li>Redis runs slower on a VM compared to running without virtualization using
        the same hardware. If you have the chance to run Redis on a physical machine
        this is preferred. However this does not mean that Redis is slow in
        virtualized environments, the delivered performances are still very good
        and most of the serious performance issues you may incur in virtualized
        environments are due to over-provisioning, non-local disks with high latency,
        or old hypervisor software that have slow <code>fork</code> syscall implementation.</li>
        <li>When the server and client benchmark programs run on the same box, both
        the TCP/IP loopback and unix domain sockets can be used. Depending on the
        platform, unix domain sockets can achieve around 50% more throughput than
        the TCP/IP loopback (on Linux for instance). The default behavior of
        redis-benchmark is to use the TCP/IP loopback.</li>
        <li>The performance benefit of unix domain sockets compared to TCP/IP loopback
        tends to decrease when pipelining is heavily used (i.e. long pipelines).</li>
        <li>When an ethernet network is used to access Redis, aggregating commands using
        pipelining is especially efficient when the size of the data is kept under
        the ethernet packet size (about 1500 bytes). Actually, processing 10 bytes,
        100 bytes, or 1000 bytes queries almost result in the same throughput.
        See the graph below.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><img src="https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/client_command/topics/Data_size.png" alt="Data size impact"></p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>On multi CPU sockets servers, Redis performance becomes dependant on the
        NUMA configuration and process location. The most visible effect is that
        redis-benchmark results seem non-deterministic because client and server
        processes are distributed randomly on the cores. To get deterministic results,
        it is required to use process placement tools (on Linux: taskset or numactl).
        The most efficient combination is always to put the client and server on two
        different cores of the same CPU to benefit from the L3 cache.
        Here are some results of 4 KB SET benchmark for 3 server CPUs (AMD Istanbul,
        Intel Nehalem EX, and Intel Westmere) with different relative placements.
        Please note this benchmark is not meant to compare CPU models between themselves
        (CPUs exact model and frequency are therefore not disclosed).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><img src="https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/6374a07f93e867353e5e946c1e39a573dfc83f6c/topics/NUMA_chart.gif" alt="NUMA chart"></p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>With high-end configurations, the number of client connections is also an
        important factor. Being based on epoll/kqueue, the Redis event loop is quite
        scalable. Redis has already been benchmarked at more than 60000 connections,
        and was still able to sustain 50000 q/s in these conditions. As a rule of thumb,
        an instance with 30000 connections can only process half the throughput
        achievable with 100 connections. Here is an example showing the throughput of
        a Redis instance per number of connections:</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><img src="https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/system_info/topics/Connections_chart.png" alt="connections chart"></p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>With high-end configurations, it is possible to achieve higher throughput by
        tuning the NIC(s) configuration and associated interruptions. Best throughput
        is achieved by setting an affinity between Rx/Tx NIC queues and CPU cores,
        and activating RPS (Receive Packet Steering) support. More information in this
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/redis-db/gUhc19gnYgc/BruTPCOroiMJ">thread</a>.
        Jumbo frames may also provide a performance boost when large objects are used.</li>
        <li>Depending on the platform, Redis can be compiled against different memory
        allocators (libc malloc, jemalloc, tcmalloc), which may have different behaviors
        in term of raw speed, internal and external fragmentation.
        If you did not compile Redis yourself, you can use the INFO command to check
        the mem_allocator field. Please note most benchmarks do not run long enough to
        generate significant external fragmentation (contrary to production Redis
        instances).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Other things to consider</h2>
        
        <p>One important goal of any benchmark is to get reproducible results, so they
        can be compared to the results of other tests.</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>A good practice is to try to run tests on isolated hardware as much as possible.
        If it is not possible, then the system must be monitored to check the benchmark
        is not impacted by some external activity.</li>
        <li>Some configurations (desktops and laptops for sure, some servers as well)
        have a variable CPU core frequency mechanism. The policy controlling this
        mechanism can be set at the OS level. Some CPU models are more aggressive than
        others at adapting the frequency of the CPU cores to the workload. To get
        reproducible results, it is better to set the highest possible fixed frequency
        for all the CPU cores involved in the benchmark.</li>
        <li>An important point is to size the system accordingly to the benchmark.
        The system must have enough RAM and must not swap. On Linux, do not forget
        to set the overcommit_memory parameter correctly. Please note 32 and 64 bit
        Redis instances do not have the same memory footprint.</li>
        <li>If you plan to use RDB or AOF for your benchmark, please check there is no other
        I/O activity in the system. Avoid putting RDB or AOF files on NAS or NFS shares,
        or on any other devices impacting your network bandwidth and/or latency
        (for instance, EBS on Amazon EC2).</li>
        <li>Set Redis logging level (loglevel parameter) to warning or notice. Avoid putting
        the generated log file on a remote filesystem.</li>
        <li>Avoid using monitoring tools which can alter the result of the benchmark. For
        instance using INFO at regular interval to gather statistics is probably fine,

        <p>Notes: changing the payload from 256 to 1024 or 4096 bytes does not change the
        numbers significantly (but reply packets are glued together up to 1024 bytes so
        GETs may be slower with big payloads). The same for the number of clients, from
        50 to 256 clients I got the same numbers. With only 10 clients it starts to get
        a bit slower.</p>
